          <span> <p>Patterns catch my attention.<br>
11:38 This pattern is from the leg press at the gym.<br>
I like to go to the gym in the morning now, which is the opposite of my schedule in the past.<br>
Last year I would love to go to the gym late at night when it was empty.<br>
Now I don’t have the same energy for that. I feel more awake in the morning, which is funny because I don’t consider myself a morning person.<br>
I wake up and look forward to going to the gym so much that I wish I could fast forward my breakfast so I could go immediately.</p>
<p>This summer I will be completing a personal training certification course and I’m so excited.<br>
It’s a ten week course and once I’m certified I have the choice to complete an internship working with a trainer at a gym near me.<br>
I hope I pass the exam on the first try.<br>
The passing rate is 70% on the first try.</p></span>

          <span> <p>11:31 I play piano before I go to bed. It seems like the only time of day I even think to play. I always see my keyboard in my room but during the day it doesn’t cross my mind to practice. I have a personal guilt about this. I should play more. It’s the reason I have the keyboard, afterall.<br>
I started playing classical piano when I was a freshman in highschool. So, I played nearly everyday in highschool and I had a lesson every Monday for four years straight. Last year as a freshman in college I didn’t have a keyboard and that has set me back quite a bit. I’m trying to catch up to where I was.</p></span>
